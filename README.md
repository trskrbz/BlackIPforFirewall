# BlackIPforFirewall
ðŸ”’ BlackIPforFirewall is a project that contains a script forÂ Mikrotik RouterOS, which automatically updates theÂ firewall address listÂ with IP addresses that have a bad reputation. The list of unwanted IP addresses is formed from various sites and projects, such as:
- [Blocklist.de](https://www.blocklist.de/en/index.html)
- [Binary Defense Systems](https://www.binarydefense.com)
- [BotScout.com](http://botscout.com/)
- [blocklist.net.ua](https://blocklist.net.ua/)
- [Collective Intelligence Network Security](http://ciarmy.com/)
- [CleanTalk](https://cleantalk.org/)
- [CruzIt.com](http://www.cruzit.com/wbl.php)
- [CyberCrime](http://cybercrime-tracker.net/)
- [C2-Tracker. C2/malware IPs from Shodan](https://github.com/montysecurity/C2-Tracker/)
- [Daniel Gerzo BruteForceBlocker](https://danger.rulez.sk/index.php/bruteforceblocker/)
- [DynDNS.org](http://security-research.dyndns.org/pub/malware-feeds/)
- [Free Proxy List](http://free-proxy-list.net/)
- [Free Proxy List](http://free-proxy-list.net/)
- [IPs exploiting the log4j2 CVE-2021-44228 detected by the crowdsec community]
- [MyIP.ms](http://myip.ms/)
- [Project Honey Pot](https://www.projecthoneypot.org)
- [GreenSnow.co](https://greensnow.co/)
- [Stamparm IPsum](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/)
- [StopForumSpam.com](http://www.stopforumspam.com/)
- [VxVault](http://vxvault.net/)

IP addresses of CDN providers are excluded from the list, including Akamai, Amazon, Arvancloud, Azure, Bing, Bunny CDN, Cloudflare, Cloudfront, DDoS Guard, Digitalocean, Fastly, Google, all Github services, G-core, Yandex Cloud, Imperva, Incapsula, Leaseweb, MaxCDN, NGenix, Oracle, Qrator, StackPath, StormWall, Sucuri, TcpShield, and X4B. The list is optimized by combining several IP addresses into one record. In the future,Â bash scriptsÂ will be added to add addresses to nftables and iptables.

ðŸŽ¯ The goal of the BlackIPforFirewall project is to provide protection for your network against IP addresses that may be associated with malware, spam, or other unwanted activity. The list of such IP addresses is regularly updated to ensure maximum protection effectiveness.

An additional script, blackip.rsc, creates a drop rule in the firewall raw, creates a separate script in the system scripts section called blackip, and a scheduler for automatic updates. The script is recommended forÂ initial installationÂ and only needs to be executed once.

## Usage (for first-time installation only)

To use the script, execute the following commands in theÂ RouterOSÂ terminal:
```Mikrotik_Terminal
tool fetch url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trskrbz/BlackIPforFirewall/main/blackip.rsc" mode=https
```
```Mikrotik_Terminal
import blackip.rsc
```
You can view the separate script in the file [blackip_onlyscript.txt](https://github.com/trskrbz/BlackIPforFirewall/blob/main/blackip_onlyscript.txt)
